Answer 75: Private security company CONSEGURIDAD S.L. failed to appoint a Data Protection Officer as required by Article 37.1(b) GDPR and Article 34.1(ñ) LOPDGDD for private security companies processing personal data on a large scale. The company operated CCTV surveillance but lacked DPO designation and failed to respond to the AEPD's communications. The AEPD imposed a €50,000 fine for this violation, considering the large-scale data processing and basic personal identifiers affected as aggravating factors.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors briefly. Article 83(2)(a) (nature/gravity/duration) was AGGRAVATING due to large-scale processing affecting many data subjects. Article 83(2)(g) (categories of data) was AGGRAVATING as basic personal identifiers were affected. Other factors were NOT_DISCUSSED.

Answer 74: WP29 Opinion 4/2007 On the concept of personal data
Answer 75: VOX España suffered a security breach where hackers accessed subscriber data for their newsletter. The DPA found inadequate security measures with 22 vulnerabilities including serious SQL injection flaws. While VOX promptly notified the breach and took remedial actions, the DPA issued a warning for violating Article 32 security obligations due to the risk of political ideology attribution from subscriber data exposure.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors systematically. Aggravating factors included nature/gravity/duration, intentional/negligent character, technical measures inadequacy, and data categories affected. Mitigating factors included actions to mitigate damage, cooperation with authority, and manner infringement became known. The combination led to a warning instead of a fine.

Personal data including DNI, phone numbers, birth dates, and health identification numbers were accessible through valid session cookies and URL manipulation. The DPA found violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 25, 32, and 33 GDPR due to inadequate security measures and failure to notify the breach.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors but not systematically. The nature/gravity/duration was aggravating, actions to mitigate damage were mitigating, and technical/organizational measures were aggravating. Cooperation with authority was aggravating due to delayed responses.

Answer 75: Vodafone continued sending electronic invoice notifications to a former customer who had no active services and had requested data deletion. The DPA found Vodafone violated Article 6 GDPR by processing personal data without a valid legal basis, as consent was lacking. Vodafone claimed a computer error caused the processing but failed to prove consent existed. The fine was reduced due to limited scope, single affected individual, and lack of fraudulent intent.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the local scope and single affected person as mitigating factors. Lack of diligence in technical measures was aggravating. The entity's cooperation in resolving the error and lack of fraudulent intent were also mitigating factors.

Answer 75: TNT Express Worldwide Spain processed a customer's personal data inaccurately by associating a personally booked and paid courier service with the customer's employer company. The DPA found a violation of Article 5(1)(d) GDPR accuracy principle as the company was incorrectly billed with the customer's personal data. A fine of €10,000 was imposed considering the defendant's regular processing of personal data as an aggravating factor.
Answer 76: The DPA considered Article 83(2)(k) as aggravating due to the defendant's regular processing of personal data in its courier business. Other Article 83(2) factors were not systematically discussed in the decision. The penalty was set at €10,000 based on this assessment.

Answer 75: A neighborhood cafe bar installed a video surveillance system with cameras capturing public transit areas without proper authorization, informative signage, or available request forms. The Spanish DPA found a violation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR (data minimization) as the system processed personal data of third parties without justification. The DPA imposed a €2000 fine considering the small establishment size and limited data protection knowledge as mitigating factors, but aggravated by previous infringements and intentionality.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors briefly. Nature/gravity was aggravating due to video surveillance in transit area without signage. Intentionality was aggravating due to previous procedure. Previous infringements were aggravating. Other factors were mitigating due to small establishment size and limited data protection knowledge.

Answer 75: A media company published audio of a rape victim's court statement without voice distortion, making her identifiable. The DPA found this violated data minimization principles under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR as the voice publication was unnecessary for journalistic purposes. The company paid a reduced fine of €30,000 after recognizing responsibility and implementing corrective measures to remove/distort the victim's voice.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Nature/gravity/duration and categories of data were aggravating due to sensitive nature of rape victim data. Negligence was aggravating. Cooperation and remedial actions were mitigating. Voluntary payment and recognition of responsibility provided additional mitigation.

Answer 75: A company sent an email to a freight transport company containing an employee's dismissal documents and accusations of attempted fraud, revealing personal data to an unauthorized third party. The Spanish DPA found a violation of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR (integrity and confidentiality) for unauthorized disclosure. The company failed to respond to the DPA's information requests and showed lack of cooperation. A fine of €10,000 was imposed considering the local scope, single affected person, lack of cooperation, and the company's small size.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included: nature/gravity/duration of infringement, negligent character, lack of technical/organizational measures, and lack of cooperation with supervisory authority. Mitigating factors included: measures to mitigate damage (though none were taken) and the company's small size as an "other mitigating factor."

Answer 75: The Spanish DPA found that Partido Aragonés Regionalista violated Article 21 GDPR by sending electoral propaganda to a complainant who had formally exercised her right to opposition through INE's official procedure. The DPA considered this a first-time infringement with limited impact, noting political parties had little time to adapt to new LOPDGDD restrictions on electoral propaganda. A warning was issued instead of a fine due to mitigating factors including the short adaptation period, limited number of affected persons, and minimal damage caused.
Answer 76: The DPA considered several mitigating factors: the very short time for political parties to adapt to new legal restrictions, the limited number of people affected, the minimal damage caused, and that this was the first occurrence. These factors led to a warning instead of a financial penalty.

Answer 75: Spanish DPA sanctioned PSC-PSOE political party for sending electoral propaganda to complainant who had exercised right to object; Party acknowledged error citing good faith and lack of training; DPA found Article 21 GDPR violation but issued only warning due to recent legal changes and party's compliance efforts.
Answer 76: DPA considered multiple mitigating factors: short adaptation period to new legal framework, party's good faith, lack of training, compliance measures implemented, and few similar claims; These factors led to downgrading from fine to warning.

Answer 75: Telefónica failed to comply with a Spanish DPA order requiring it to fulfill a data subject's access rights request. The DPA found this constituted a violation of Article 58(2) GDPR for non-compliance with supervisory authority orders. The company argued it had responded to the complaint but the DPA determined full access was not provided. A €30,000 fine was imposed considering the company's large size as aggravating and lack of direct benefits as mitigating.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors briefly. The entity's large size was considered aggravating. The lack of direct benefits from the infringement was considered mitigating. No other factors were explicitly discussed.

Answer 75: The Spanish Tax Administration Agency maintained inaccurate data about a claimant since 2012 showing a tax offense annotation. This led to incorrect tax certificates being issued to Social Security authorities. The DPA found a violation of Article 5(1)(d) accuracy principle but issued only a warning since the agency had implemented corrective measures including application improvements and review procedures.
Answer 76: The DPA did not systematically discuss Article 83(2) factors. Only the mitigating factor of actions taken to correct the damage was mentioned, as the agency had implemented technical improvements and review procedures following the complaint.

Answer 75: A Polish complainant requested account deletion from Glovo via customer service chat but received only automated responses. The Spanish DPA as lead authority found Glovo violated Article 12 GDPR by failing to properly handle data subject rights requests through alternative channels. The DPA issued a reprimand considering it a minor infringement due to one-off error, corrective measures taken, and no previous similar incidents.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors systematically. Aggravating: inadequate technical measures. Mitigating: nature/gravity/duration (minor), negligent character (not intentional), actions to mitigate damage (corrective measures), no previous infringements, cooperation with authority, and other factors (one-off error). Neutral: categories of personal data affected and manner infringement became known.

Answer 75: Iberia continued processing customer data after consent withdrawal and erasure request, sending marketing emails due to manual mailing list error. This constituted a repeat infringement as similar issues occurred in prior procedure PS/00370/2018. The DPA found violation of Article 6.1 GDPR for processing without valid legal basis. A fine of €20,000 was imposed considering negligence and previous infringements as aggravating factors, and remedial actions as mitigating.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors briefly. Intentionality/negligence (b) and previous infringements (e) were aggravating. Actions to mitigate damage (c) were mitigating. Other factors were not discussed.

Answer 75: BBVA disclosed a lawyer's private address to his client when providing claim documentation. The DPA found violations of purpose limitation (Art 5(1)(b)), security (Art 32), and confidentiality (Art 5(1)(f)). The bank claimed it was an isolated error but the DPA found negligence given BBVA's professional data processing obligations.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Negligence was aggravating (Art 83(2)(b)). The limited scope affecting only one data subject was mitigating (Art 83(2)(a)). BBVA's large size and data processing activities were additional aggravating factors (Art 83(2)(k)).

Answer 75: A Spanish municipality published a census of communal agricultural uses containing names, surnames and complete ID numbers on its notice board and website. The Spanish DPA found this violated Article 5(1)(f) GDPR (integrity and confidentiality). The municipality immediately removed the data and implemented corrective measures. Due to the public entity status and mitigating factors, only a warning was issued under Article 77.2 LOPDGDD.
Answer 76: The DPA considered several mitigating factors: the municipality immediately corrected the error, implemented GDPR compliance measures, cooperated with the authority, and the incident occurred during a transition period in local government. No aggravating factors were discussed. The overall assessment led to a reduced sanction.

Answer 75: A mother filed a complaint against CaixaBank for failing to provide information about her minor daughter's bank account and for improperly disclosing information about another daughter. The AEPD found that while the right of access was ultimately fulfilled, CaixaBank violated Article 32.1 GDPR by having inadequate security measures that led to providing data about the wrong daughter without proper identity verification. The bank was fined €25,000 and ordered to implement measures to prevent similar incidents.
Answer 76: The AEPD considered the nature and seriousness of the infringement as aggravating, particularly affecting minors' data. The defendant's activity being linked to data processing and their large business volume were also aggravating factors. The intentionality/negligence was considered aggravating due to serious lack of diligence. A merger process was considered a mitigating circumstance.

Answer 75: The Spanish DPA initiated proceedings against BBB for failing to respond to information requests during an investigation. BBB did not respond to two separate information requests nor submit allegations to either the initiation agreement or proposed resolution. The DPA found a violation of Article 58.1 GDPR for obstructing investigative powers but issued only a warning sanction considering BBB was a self-employed entrepreneur.
Answer 76: The DPA considered Article 83(2)(a) as mitigating due to the nature of the infringement and defendant being self-employed. No other Article 83(2) factors were discussed in detail.

Answer 75: An individual published personal data including photographs and intimate details about his ex-partner on a publicly accessible website without valid consent. The DPA rejected the domestic activity exception and found the BDSM contract invalid as contrary to public order. The defendant was fined €1,500 for violating Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature, severity and duration of the offense as aggravating factors, noting the processing lasted from March to October 2020. Intentionality was also considered aggravating. The lack of linkage between the defendant's activity and personal data processing was considered mitigating. The defendant's economic circumstances led to a reduced fine based on proportionality.

Answer 75: Orange España required courier delivery personnel to photograph both sides of recipients' national ID cards during product delivery. The Spanish DPA found this practice violated the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, as it collected excessive personal data beyond what was necessary for identity verification. The DPA rejected Orange's contract execution legal basis argument, noting less intrusive methods were available for delivery verification.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature/gravity/duration of the infringement as aggravating, the intentional/negligent character as aggravating, and the categories of personal data affected as aggravating. Other Article 83(2) factors were not systematically discussed.

Answer 75: Vodafone España violated GDPR accuracy and confidentiality principles due to a system error during migration that caused data crossing between customers. A third party appeared as owner of claimant's services, and the company mistakenly sent another customer's resolution to the claimant. The DPA found violations of Articles 5.1.d) and 5.1.f) GDPR, with proposed fines totaling €90,000 reduced to €54,000 after voluntary payment and acknowledgment of responsibility.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors briefly. Aggravating factors included: negligent character (Art 83.2.b), categories of personal data affected (Art 83.2.g), and nature/gravity/duration (Art 83.2.a). No mitigating factors were discussed. The assessment was limited to these three factors.

Answer 75: Spanish DPA fined Glovoapp23 SL €25,000 for failing to appoint a Data Protection Officer despite conducting large-scale processing operations requiring regular and systematic observation of data subjects. The company claimed exemption but was found to process personal data on a large scale. The DPA determined the violation of Article 37 GDPR constituted a serious infringement under Article 83.4.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors briefly, finding aggravating circumstances in the large number of data subjects affected (Art 83.2(a)) and the nature of basic personal identifiers processed (Art 83.2(g)). No mitigating factors were mentioned. The discussion was limited to these two criteria.

Answer 75: The Gijón City Council failed to maintain and publish a record of processing activities as required by Articles 30 GDPR and 31 LOPDGDD. The defendant acknowledged the registry was in validation process but not published, citing organizational changes and COVID-19 delays. The AEPD issued a warning under Article 77 LOPDGDD rather than a fine since the defendant is a public entity, and noted the registry was eventually published in June 2021.

Answer 75: Spanish DPA sanctioned XFERA MÓVILES for failing to respond to multiple information requests during an investigation, obstructing the DPA's investigative powers under Article 58(1) GDPR.

Answer 75: A pub was accused of violating Article 13 GDPR by lacking CCTV warning signs on its facade. The defendant claimed signs were repeatedly stolen and promptly replaced. The DPA found no culpability due to demonstrated diligence in maintaining signage despite thefts. The case was dismissed without penalty.
Answer 76: The DPA found mitigating factors including lack of negligence (Art 83(2)(b)), cooperation with authorities (Art 83(2)(f)), and actions to mitigate damage through prompt replacement of stolen signs. No systematic discussion of Article 83(2) factors occurred.

Answer 75: EDREAMS charged a customer €50 for correcting a name error on a flight ticket, violating Article 12 GDPR which requires free exercise of data subject rights. The DPA found this was a manual error by an agent who failed to clarify the charge breakdown. EDREAMS took remedial actions including refunding the customer, compensating the full trip cost, and implementing staff training. The DPA issued a warning instead of a fine considering it a minor first-time infringement with prompt mitigation measures.
Answer 76: The DPA considered multiple mitigating factors: the minor nature of the infringement, the negligent rather than intentional character, actions taken to mitigate damage including full refund and compensation, implementation of organizational measures through staff training, no previous infringements, and cooperation with the authority. These factors led to a warning instead of a financial penalty.

Answer 75: A homeowners association installed CCTV cameras that excessively recorded public transit areas and sidewalks beyond their private perimeter. The Spanish DPA found this violated Article 5(1)(c) GDPR (data minimization principle) as the cameras captured unnecessary public areas without justification. The DPA imposed a €3,000 fine and ordered correction of camera orientation within one month.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature of the infringement (capturing public areas without cause) and negligence (poor camera orientation) as aggravating factors under Article 83(2)(a) and (b). No mitigating factors were discussed. The fine was set at the lower scale for this type of violation.

Answer 75: The Spanish DPA sanctioned KUKIMBIA S.L. for abandoning documentation containing personal data of customers and suppliers in a public area. The company failed to implement adequate security measures under Article 32.1 GDPR, allowing unauthorized access to personal data. The DPA found the conduct deeply negligent and imposed a €3,000 fine considering the local scope but aggravating factors including lack of cooperation.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature/gravity/duration as aggravating due to abandoned documentation affecting many people. Intentional/negligent character was aggravating as conduct was deeply negligent. Actions to mitigate damage were aggravating as no measures were adopted. Technical measures were aggravating due to security breach. Cooperation was aggravating as no response to information request. Other factors were mitigating as it was a small business.

Answer 75: Vodafone España was sanctioned for violating Article 48.1.b of Spanish Telecommunications Law in relation to Article 21 GDPR by making persistent marketing calls to a claimant who had exercised his right to object in 2017. The AEPD found Vodafone responsible as controller for calls made by its processors using both Vodafone-provided databases and their own databases. The sanction was based on Vodafone's failure to honor the data subject's objection right and its history of over 50 previous similar violations.
Answer 76: The AEPD considered aggravating factors including previous offenses, benefit obtained by the offender, damage caused, and lack of cessation of infringing activity. Mitigating factors included remedial actions taken. The sanction amount was set at €50,000 representing 2.5% of the maximum possible fine.

Answer 75: A sports club published a judicial sentence containing personal data of a former board member on its website and Facebook. The DPA found the publication violated Article 6(1) GDPR as the legitimate interest basis was invalid - the club's interest in informing members did not prevail over the data subject's rights. The publication was disproportionate and not limited to club members.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement as aggravating, noting the data remained accessible through search engines despite removal attempts. Intentionality/negligence was aggravating due to lack of diligence in data removal. Measures to mitigate damage were aggravating as adequate measures were not implemented.

Answer 75: The Madrid Ministry of Health was sanctioned for a nurse's unauthorized access to a colleague's medical records. The DPA found insufficient security measures despite existing protocols, as they were reactive rather than preventive. The controller failed to implement adequate access controls that would restrict healthcare professionals to only patients under their care.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature of health data and inadequate security measures as aggravating factors. No mitigating factors were discussed. The decision focused on the seriousness of the breach rather than systematic Article 83(2) analysis.

Answer 75: Hertz Spain erroneously associated complainant's email with another customer's rental contract, sending traffic fine notifications containing personal data to wrong recipient. Despite complainant's notification, second email was sent weeks later due to internal coordination failures. AEPD found violations of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR but considered it minor, issuing warning instead of fine.
Answer 76: AEPD discussed Article 83(2) factors: nature/gravity/duration was mitigating (isolated incident), measures to mitigate damage were mitigating (quick response), technical measures were aggravating (inadequate security). Other factors were not discussed. Overall assessment led to warning rather than fine.

Answer 75: DIGI issued a duplicate SIM card to an impersonator who fraudulently obtained it from a distributor point of sale. The AEPD found DIGI violated Article 6(1) GDPR as the processing lacked a lawful basis when the duplicate was issued to a third party instead of the legitimate data subject. The AEPD rejected DIGI's arguments about prior phishing and imposed a €70,000 fine, citing inadequate diligence in identity verification procedures.
Answer 76: The AEPD systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included the nature/gravity/duration of infringement, negligent character, degree of responsibility, and link between business activity and data processing. Mitigating factor was actions taken to mitigate damage. The absence of previous infringements and lack of benefits obtained were considered neutral factors, not mitigating.

Answer 75: The Madrid Health Department was sanctioned for unauthorized access to a hospital employee's medical records by a coworker. The DPA found insufficient security measures despite claimed protocols, violating confidentiality principles. The defendant failed to implement proper access controls limiting staff to patients under their care. Security measures were reactive rather than preventive.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors including nature/gravity as aggravating, data categories as aggravating, and mitigation efforts as mitigating. The lack of adequate technical measures was considered aggravating while cooperation was neutral.

The DPA also ordered corrective measures to respect data protection rights of those refusing consent.

Answer 75: The City Council of La Canonja implemented a fingerprint-based time control system for municipal workers without proper legal basis or impact assessment. The DPA found processing of biometric data without Article 9 exception violated Article 5(1)(a) lawfulness principle. The failure to conduct a required data protection impact assessment violated Article 35. The Council was ordered to implement a non-biometric alternative system.

Answer 75: This is an advisory opinion from Slovenia's Information Commissioner addressing COVID-19 workplace measures. The opinion states employers must take a holistic approach to infection prevention, assessing necessity and proportionality of any personal data processing. For health testing, employers must follow competent authorities' instructions and may collect only necessary information. For travel data, such processing generally infringes privacy unless based on valid non-coerced consent.

Answer 75: The Slovenian Information Commissioner found that a solar power plant repair company violated Articles 12 and 15 GDPR by failing to respond timely and comprehensively to a data subject's access request. The controller initially provided inadequate responses and invited the data subject to inspect documents onsite rather than providing copies. While the controller eventually complied after supervisory authority intervention, the violation occurred due to the delayed and incomplete initial response.

Answer 75: Individual forwarded email containing residential addresses and dates of birth of two individuals to 46 recipients during legal dispute proceedings. DPA found no legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR or Article 8 ZVOP-1 for this disclosure. Warning issued instead of fine due to mitigating circumstances including broader context of long-standing legal claims.
Answer 76: DPA considered broader circumstances of offense as mitigating factor under Article 83(2). The violator's long-standing legal claims against state authorities and specific civil servants were considered as mitigating circumstances justifying a warning instead of fine.

Answer 36: The case centered on Article 20 of ZVOP-2 which allows controllers to refuse data access requests from legal representatives when disclosure would harm the minor's interests. The provider applied this exception broadly to all medical records without specific assessment, while the Commissioner required a proportional, document-by-document evaluation weighing child protection against parental access rights.

Answer 75: The Slovenian Information Commissioner partially granted a parent's appeal against a healthcare provider's decision to deny access to medical records of his minor daughter. The Commissioner found the provider improperly applied Article 20 of ZVOP-2 broadly without specific assessment of each document. The decision required disclosure of most records while concealing specific sensitive portions indirectly related to alleged abuse to protect the child's mental health.

Answer 74: EDPB Guidelines on consent as a legal basis for the processing of personal data in employment relationships
Answer 75: The Slovenian Information Commissioner provided a non-binding opinion on employer COVID-19 testing practices. The opinion clarifies that health data processing requires appropriate legal bases under Article 6 and Article 9 GDPR, noting consent is problematic in employment relationships. Sectoral regulations may provide legal basis for mandatory testing in healthcare and education sectors, but employers must follow data minimization principles.

Answer 75: Water Canal Ilfov SA was fined for GDPR security violations after a data breach notification. The breach occurred when email addresses were mistakenly placed in the "To" field instead of "BCC" when sending messages to users, resulting in unauthorized disclosure of personal data. The DPA found the operator failed to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure security corresponding to processing risk. The breach affected a significant number of individuals.
Answer 76: The DPA found the nature/gravity of the infringement aggravating due to the security failure. The manner the infringement became known (through self-reporting) was mitigating. The lack of adequate technical/organizational measures was aggravating. Cooperation with the authority was mitigating.

Answer 75: The Italian DPA dismissed a complaint against MF Service S.r.l., publisher of Milano Finanza newspaper, regarding an article about a public official involved in mask procurement investigation. The DPA found the controller had properly updated the article to reflect revocation of house arrest measures and maintained the article's public interest value since criminal proceedings were ongoing. The Authority determined no GDPR violations occurred as the article contained no factual inaccuracies and the right to rectification under Article 16 was not applicable.

Answer 75: The Italian DPA found violations in Menarini Silicon Biosystems' processing of health data for AI tool development. The company processed pseudonymized health data from cancer patients to train its CellFind algorithm for multiple myeloma detection. The DPA confirmed breaches of transparency, storage limitation, and accountability principles, but dismissed the purpose limitation challenge after company clarifications.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically applied Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included the nature of health data and processing context. Mitigating factors included lack of intent, cooperation with authorities, absence of material harm from storage violations, and innovative technology context. The fine was reduced to €21,000 considering these factors.

Answer 75: Poste Vita S.p.A. disclosed personal data relating to life insurance policies to an unauthorized third party who impersonated the data subject via email requests containing forged signatures and detailed policy information.

The company argued it was deceived by sophisticated fraud but was found negligent in its verification procedures.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included the significant nature of violations affecting general principles and negligent conduct. Mitigating factors included immediate investigation initiation, cooperation with authorities, absence of precedents, and implementation of corrective measures. The financial situation was considered but not detailed.

Answer 75: Ryanair DAC failed to respond to a subject access request within the statutory timeframe due to human error where an agent failed to reassign the request before leaving. This resulted in irreversible deletion of call recordings due to the 90-day retention policy, preventing full compliance with the access request. The DPC issued a reprimand under Article 58(2)(b) considering the risk to fundamental rights and the controller's remedial measures.
Answer 76: The DPC considered human error and subsequent remedial measures as mitigating factors. The controller implemented technical changes to prevent future errors and enhanced transparency about retention periods. No aggravating factors were discussed.

Answer 75: DPC investigated DSP's use of facial matching technology for Public Services Card registration (SAFE 2). Found DSP lacked valid lawful basis for biometric data collection and retention under Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1), 9(1) and 5(1)(e). Also violated transparency obligations under Articles 13(1)(c) and 13(2)(a) and DPIA requirements under Article 35(7)(b) and (c). DPC issued reprimand, €550,000 fine, and order to cease biometric processing within 9 months if no lawful basis established.
Answer 76: DPC discussed nature/gravity as aggravating due to scale and sensitivity of biometric data processing affecting 70% of population. Technical measures were found adequate and neutral. Other Article 83(2) factors were not systematically discussed.

Answer 75: DPC investigated Department of Health's processing of personal data in 29 litigation files involving special educational needs cases. Found infringements: processing sensitive personal data obtained through broad scoping questions was excessive and disproportionate; privacy notice lacked details of information sharing practices; inadequate security measures. Fine imposed and ban on processing sensitive data for settlement purposes.
Answer 76: DPC considered GDPR factors but did not systematically discuss Article 83(2). Nature/gravity of infringement, categories of personal data affected, and technical/organizational measures were aggravating factors in sanction determination.

Answer 75: Groupon required excessive ID verification for data subject rights requests, violating data minimization principles. The company failed to properly handle access and erasure requests initially but later corrected procedures. The DPC found infringements of Articles 5(1)(c), 6(1), 12(2), 15(1), 15(3) and 17(1) GDPR but determined an administrative fine would not be proportionate, issuing only a reprimand.
Answer 76: The DPC considered Article 83(2) factors but found an administrative fine would not be necessary, proportionate or dissuasive given the circumstances and remedial actions taken by Groupon. The DPC opted for a reprimand instead of financial penalty.

Answer 75: The DPC conducted an inquiry into A&G Couriers Limited following an audit which revealed multiple GDPR violations. The company failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection principles. Violations included inadequate data retention policies, excessive data collection, and insufficient security measures. The DPC found breaches across all Article 5 principles and issued corrective orders.
Answer 76: The DPC systematically applied Article 83(2) factors in determining the administrative fine. The nature/gravity/duration, intentional/negligent character, technical measures, and categories of data affected were aggravating factors. Cooperation with the authority and actions to mitigate damage were mitigating factors. Other mitigating circumstances were also considered.

Answer 75: A teacher at Breiðholt Multicultural School mistakenly emailed sensitive student information to unauthorized recipients. The DPA found inadequate security measures violated integrity/confidentiality requirements. The school took prompt remedial actions but lacked proper organizational measures to prevent such errors.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Nature of sensitive data was aggravating, while negligence (not intent), mitigation measures, cooperation, and first-time offense were mitigating. The violation was not long-term but involved significant privacy reduction.

Answer 75: The Icelandic DPA ruled on a complaint against Landsbankinn regarding its request for year-end balance information from complainant's account at another bank during cash withdrawal due diligence. The DPA found the processing lawful under Article 6(1)(c) as necessary to fulfill anti-money laundering obligations. The proportionality requirement was satisfied as the bank requested only year-end balance rather than full transaction history. No GDPR violations were found.

Answer 75: The Icelandic DPA issued an opinion finding that the Citizens' Ombudsman's processing of personal data through an HTTP-only complaint form violated security requirements under national law and GDPR. The DPA determined that HTTP protocols created significant risk of unauthorized third-party access to personal data, while HTTPS protocols provide encrypted communication. Although the website was subsequently updated to support HTTPS, the DPA found the previous processing non-compliant but saw no grounds for further action.

Answer 75: The Icelandic DPA ruled that an employer violated data protection laws by disclosing call records to an employee's ex-wife without legal basis and improperly handling the employee's email after retirement. The company failed to provide proper notice for email inspection, offer deletion/copying options, or close the mailbox within required timeframe. The DPA ordered closure of the mailbox but imposed no fine due to company bankruptcy.

Answer 75: The Icelandic DPA audited Landspítali hospital's transfer of COVID-19 testing operations to Icelandic Genetics' office. The DPA found the hospital relied on an inadequate data protection impact assessment that didn't cover the new processing scenario where Icelandic Genetics employees had access to patient names and IDs. While no security deficiencies were found, the DPA criticized the hospital for proceeding without proper assessment and delayed cooperation with the authority.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed cooperation as aggravating due to delayed responses, and pandemic circumstances as mitigating. Most Article 83(2) factors were not systematically addressed.

DPA found this violated data minimization and contract necessity principles under Article 6(1)(b). Processing was not necessary for ticket delivery as other identification methods were available. Fine imposed due to widespread practice and duration of violation.
Answer 76: DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors. Nature/duration was aggravating as violation affected many individuals over time. Negligence was mitigating as company acted in good faith. Cooperation was aggravating due to delayed responses. Special category data was aggravating as ID numbers have special protection.

Answer 75: The City of Reykjavík's Eastern Center sent a locked report containing a child's health information via email to an unauthorized recipient, along with the password in a separate email to the same address. The DPA found this violated data protection principles as the security measure was ineffective when password and document were sent to the same recipient. The processing lacked legal basis and appropriate security measures, though the DPA considered the city's response measures sufficient and issued no further instructions.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the sensitive nature of children's health data as aggravating, but the city's prompt breach notification, cooperation with authorities, and remedial actions (contacting recipient for deletion, informing parents) as mitigating factors. No systematic Article 83(2) discussion was conducted.

Answer 75: The case involved a complaint about Landsbankinn's refusal of an access request for email communications between bank employees that concerned their work for a trade union (SSF) rather than bank operations. The DPA found the bank was not the controller for this data as it did not relate to the bank's activities. The refusal was deemed lawful as the assessment of access rights fell under SSF as the responsible party.

Answer 75: A law firm sent a claim letter containing sensitive personal data (salary, labor market measures, trade union membership) to both the complainant's personal email and a municipality's general email address. The DPA found the law firm acted as controller, not processor, and failed to demonstrate necessity for sharing data with the municipality. The processing violated GDPR as it lacked legal basis under Articles 6(1)(f) and 9(2)(f).

Answer 75: The Icelandic DPA fined the Office of the National Medical Examiner ISK 12,000,000 for security weaknesses in the Heilsuvera health portal that allowed unauthorized access to patient data. Two vulnerabilities existed: message section access through parameter manipulation (2015-2020) and maternity care attachment access through URL modification (2019-2020). The DPA found violations of Articles 5(1)(f), 25, and 32 due to inadequate security measures for sensitive health data.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included nature/gravity/duration of breach, negligent character, responsibility for technical measures, and categories of sensitive data. Mitigating factors included actions to reduce damage and voluntary breach reporting. The public service role of the defendant was considered as another mitigating factor.

Answer 75: Creditinfo Lánstraust hf., a financial information agency, registered loan default information from eCommerce 2020 ApS without verifying that registration conditions were met. The DPA found violations of GDPR principles (lawfulness, fairness, transparency, and accountability) because the agency failed to check loan terms for proper authorization clauses and minimum amount requirements. The fine was based on the processing's onerous nature, profit motive, core business relevance, and delayed corrective actions.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included the nature/gravity/duration of the breach, negligence, inadequate technical measures, categories of data affected, and profit motive. Mitigating factors included cooperation with the DPA and actions to reduce damage. The fine amount was set at 2.5% of annual turnover considering these factors.

Answer 75: The Norwegian Fisheries Agency conducted covert video surveillance of a fishing vessel using binoculars with attached recording equipment. The DPA found no legal authorization existed for this processing method under fisheries laws at the time, as inspections were required to be conducted in-person. The processing violated transparency requirements as the data subject was not warned about the surveillance. No corrective measures were issued due to subsequent legal changes authorizing such surveillance methods.

The DPA found it unproven that automated processing or processing for law enforcement purposes occurred under Act no. 75/2019. The DPA concluded the alleged activities did not fall within the scope of data protection laws as oral transmission alone generally doesn't constitute processing under Icelandic law.

Answer 75: The Icelandic Data Protection Authority ruled on a complaint regarding the Police in the capital area's retention of personal information after an investigation was cancelled. The Authority found that personal information unrelated to the investigation was deleted without undue delay (within 2.5 months) and that processing delays were justified due to summer vacation and staff illness. The Police's actions were found to be in compliance with Act no. 75/2019 on processing of personal information for law enforcement purposes.

Answer 75: Íslandspóst used tachograph data from an employee's vehicle for performance evaluation and dismissal, which exceeded the originally stated purpose of improving driving style and road safety. The DPA found the processing unlawful due to purpose limitation violation and lack of transparency about the secondary purpose. No consent was valid due to employer-employee power imbalance, though legitimate interests could justify the original monitoring purpose.

Answer 75: A former employee requested access to his 2018 workplace email archive after termination. The university denied access entirely. The DPA found the university breached Article 15 by refusing access to private emails and Article 12 by failing to provide transparent information. The DPA ordered access to private emails and imposed a HUF 200,000 fine.
Answer 76: The DPA considered nature/gravity/duration as aggravating, actions to mitigate damage as aggravating, technical measures as aggravating, previous infringements as mitigating, and other factors as aggravating. The fine was set near the minimum considering mitigating circumstances.

Answer 75: The Hungarian DPA found ROBINSON-TOURS violated GDPR Articles 25(1)-(2), 32(1)(b), and 34(1) due to a website vulnerability that exposed personal data of 781 travelers including children. The data was accessible via Google search without authentication from November 2019 to February 2020. The DPA ordered a €20M HUF fine and mandated notification to data subjects.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors systematically. Aggravating factors included high-risk data nature, systemic security failures, and external discovery. Mitigating factors included lack of intentionality and no prior infringements. Cooperation and prompt reporting were noted but not explicitly mitigating.

Answer 75: The case involved an employee complaint about inaccurate temporary address data retention and unauthorized data transfer to a financial institution. The DPA found violations of accuracy principle (Article 5(1)(d)), right to rectification/erasure (Articles 16-17), transparency obligations (Article 13), and invalid legal basis for data transfer (Article 6). The controller failed to properly respond to data subject requests and transferred personal data without adequate legal basis or information.
Answer 76: The DPA considered several mitigating factors: no harm to data subjects, first-time infringement, deletion of data after procedure initiation, single data subject affected, and transfer intended to benefit employees. Other Article 83(2) factors were not considered relevant. A fine was imposed as warning was deemed insufficient.

Answer 75: The Hungarian DPA found that a politician collected signatures for a political initiative without valid consent. The controller processed political opinion data (special category) without explicit consent and failed to provide adequate information. The DPA ordered deletion of all collected data and imposed a 1 million HUF fine for violations of Articles 5,6,9 and 13.
Answer 76: The DPA considered special category data and duration as aggravating factors. It considered the breach negligible in nature and first-time offense as mitigating factors. Non-compliance with prior orders was also aggravating.

Answer 75: The Hungarian DPA found a private company violated GDPR principles by installing CCTV cameras that monitored both property protection areas and employee workstations. The camera angle in one room allowed unreasonable monitoring of workers, violating purpose limitation and data minimization principles. Additionally, the company failed to provide adequate information about the CCTV system to employees for several months after implementation began.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors including previous infringements as aggravating, cooperation as neutral, and limited scope of affected persons as mitigating. The fine was set considering the company's large size and the duration of infringements.

Answer 75: The Hungarian DPA found a telecom provider violated Article 16 (right to rectification) and Article 5(1)(d) (accuracy principle) by failing to properly update a customer's email address despite notification. The provider manually corrected the address but failed to update it in their campaign management system, causing newsletters to continue to the old address. The DPA issued a warning rather than a fine due to the low gravity, negligent nature, and eventual correction of the infringement.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors and found: low gravity (mitigating), negligent conduct (mitigating), no special data categories (mitigating), and eventual correction of the infringement (mitigating). Previous infringements were considered but found not relevant (neutral). A warning was deemed proportionate rather than a fine.

Answer 75: Hungarian DPA found Google Ireland Ltd violated Articles 12(3) and 15(1) GDPR by failing to provide adequate information on processing of applicant's personal data in Google AdWords within required timeframe. The case involved cross-border processing with Hungarian DPA acting as lead authority after coordination with Irish DPA. Google eventually provided the information during proceedings, making compliance orders unnecessary. A fine of HUF 10,000 was imposed for procedural delays.

Answer 75: The Hungarian DPA investigated MarkMyProfessor Kft. for failing to respond to data subject requests from university lecturers who objected to offensive comments posted about them on the markmyprofessor.com website. The company failed to provide information within the one-month timeframe required by GDPR and infringed data subjects' right to information and transparency principles. The case originated from a complaint filed by the University of Debrecen on behalf of its lecturers.

Answer 75: The case involved a data subject complaint regarding the right of access under Article 15. The controller provided only general data management information and references to website policies rather than personalized information about the specific data processing. The Authority found this insufficient and ordered the controller to provide complete, specific information about the data subject's personal data processing.
Answer 76: The Authority considered Article 83(2) factors and found the infringement severity was low, no harm occurred, and this was the controller's first GDPR violation. These mitigating factors led to a warning instead of a fine.

Camera angles monitored excessive areas including tanning machines and public space without masking.
Answer 76: The DPA considered delayed/incomplete responses aggravating, while cessation of operations was mitigating. No systematic Article 83(2) discussion was conducted.

The DPA found the initial processing lawful under Article 6(1)(e) but found unauthorized processing occurred between document transfer and deletion. The defendant violated access rights by providing false information about the recording's availability and deletion status.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the defendant's deceptive behavior and obstruction of rights as aggravating factors. Mitigating factors included the defendant's admission of wrongdoing and its social welfare function. The Authority waived a fine in favor of a warning due to these circumstances.

Answer 75: The Hungarian DPA found two joint controllers violated GDPR in a political signature collection campaign. The controllers collected personal data without valid legal basis, provided inadequate information about processing purposes, and failed to demonstrate accountability. The DPA ordered data deletion, issued reprimands, and imposed 3 million HUF fines on each controller for processing special category data without proper consent and transparency.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included: serious nature affecting many data subjects, multiple violations, long duration, negligent conduct, special category data, and lack of cooperation. Mitigating factor for one controller was being a natural person. The fine was imposed considering both specific and general deterrence objectives.

Answer 75: Magyar Telekom processed an email address erroneously provided by a third party customer and failed to delete it despite repeated requests from the actual data subject. The DPA found violations of accuracy principles, transparency obligations, and erasure rights, noting this was part of a recurring pattern of similar infringements. The company's organizational measures were inadequate as they required unnecessary administrative barriers like account login for non-customers to exercise data subject rights.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included persistent internal procedural problems, previous similar infringements, and the company's large size. Mitigating factors included the unintentional nature of the breach, deletion after Authority intervention, and that only contact data (not sensitive) was affected. The fine was set at 0.04% of annual turnover considering both aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

Answer 75: The Hungarian DPA found a car repair company violated GDPR by using CCTV cameras that monitored employees excessively in office-waiting and kitchen areas. The company improperly relied on employee consent instead of legitimate interest, failed to conduct balancing test, and provided inadequate information to employees. The DPA ordered camera angle adjustments, policy revisions, and imposed a HUF 500,000 fine.
Answer 76: The DPA considered aggravating factors including duration of infringement and notification via complaint after prior warnings. Mitigating factors included small number of affected persons, limited scope to two cameras, no specific harm, negligence rather than intent, and first-time violation. Cooperation was noted but not explicitly mitigating.

Answer 75: An individual secretly recorded a kindergarten meeting discussing a child's behavioral and health issues, then shared the recording in a parents' Facebook group and via email. The Hungarian DPA found violations of GDPR principles (lawfulness, fairness, purpose limitation, data minimization) and Articles 6 and 9 regarding legal basis for processing special category data. The DPA issued a reprimand and ordered deletion of the recording.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the sensitive nature of health data and secret recording as aggravating factors. The defendant's lack of malicious intent, short duration of availability, and prompt removal were mitigating factors. A warning was deemed proportionate rather than a fine.

Answer 75: The Hungarian DPA found a travel services company violated GDPR when it failed to properly process a data subject's newsletter unsubscribe requests due to a technical system error. The company continued sending marketing emails for nearly two years after the data subject withdrew consent, violating Articles 6(1)(a), 12(3) and 25(1). The DPA issued a reprimand and ordered the company to inform the data subject about deletion measures taken.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the prolonged duration (July 2019-May 2021) as aggravating, the company's cooperation and corrective actions as mitigating, and inadequate technical measures as aggravating. Other factors were not systematically discussed.

Answer 75: The Hungarian DPA found TV2 Media Group violated GDPR Articles 5(1)(a), 5(1)(b), 6(1), 12(1) and 13 regarding cookie consent practices on their websites. The consent framework was non-transparent, used misleading terminology, lacked adequate information, and had parallel consent systems. The DPA ordered compliance within 30 days and imposed a 10 million HUF fine considering the intentional nature, scale affecting millions, and lack of previous violations.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included: nature/gravity/duration affecting millions, intentional character for profit, categories of personal data involved profiling. Mitigating factors included: no previous infringements, ongoing industry transition context. The cooperation was assessed as neutral.

Answer 75: The Hungarian DPA found a grocery store violated Article 6(1)(f) GDPR by operating CCTV that disproportionately monitored public areas including sidewalks, roads, and parking spaces beyond what was necessary for property protection. The store had a legitimate interest in security but the scope was excessive. The DPA issued a warning and ordered compliance by limiting monitoring to only the sidewalk directly in front of the store.
Answer 76: The DPA considered this a first violation and mitigating that the controller took measures during proceedings to reduce monitoring scope. No fine was imposed as the violation was considered minor under GDPR Recital 148.

Answer 75: ALDI Hungary implemented age verification practices for alcohol purchases that violated GDPR principles. The DPA found violations of transparency, data minimization, legal basis, information obligations, and data security requirements. The court annulled part of the original decision regarding log file storage but upheld other violations, leading to a reduced fine of HUF 80 million.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors systematically. Aggravating circumstances included nature/gravity of violations, number of affected data subjects, national scope of violations, and manner of discovery. Mitigating circumstances included narrow categories of data affected and consumer protection purpose. Neutral circumstances included cooperation, remedial measures, and previous infringements.

Answer 75: Two individual co-owners installed a CCTV camera monitoring common stairwell areas and public space through a window. The DPA found violations of Article 6(1) GDPR (invalid legitimate interest basis) and Article 13(1)-(2) GDPR (inadequate information). The DPA issued a reprimand and ordered compliance by adjusting camera angle/masking, relocating, or dismantling within 11 days.
Answer 76: The DPA considered Article 83(2) factors but did not impose a fine. Aggravating factors included the nature/gravity of monitoring common/public spaces. Mitigating factors included defendants being individuals, first-time offenders, and the infringement affecting only limited surroundings.

Answer 75: The Budapest Bar Association failed to respond to a data subject's access request within the GDPR timeframe, violating Articles 12(3) and 15(1),(3). The DPA found the controller exceeded the 30-day response period without proper extension notification. The Authority issued a reprimand but waived a fine considering the public body nature and procedural duration.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the prolonged administrative deadline (150 days) as aggravating, but considered remedial actions taken and the defendant's public body status as mitigating factors. No systematic Article 83(2) analysis was conducted.

Answer 75: The Hungarian DPA rejected a complaint regarding a bank's processing of a child's personal data in connection with a babysitting loan program. The bank copied the child's birth certificate, tax certificate, and address card to verify eligibility for repayment suspension under Hungarian government decree.

Answer 75: The Hungarian DPA found Amplifon violated GDPR by processing name/address data from national address register for direct marketing disguised as market research. The company sent postal invitations for hearing screenings to 300,000-400,000 elderly individuals without valid legal basis (consent invalid) and inadequate information. Violations included unfair processing, purpose limitation, and transparency obligations.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating: serious nature of violations, large number of data subjects (elderly vulnerable group), negligent behavior, previous infringement. Mitigating: no prior GDPR violation, took remedial actions after inspection. Neutral: cooperation with authority, manner of detection.

Answer 75: The Hungarian DPA found the National Health Insurance Fund Manager violated GDPR by failing to respond to data subject requests within statutory deadlines and lacking transparent procedures for identification. The controller hindered rights exercise by requiring formal identification methods not communicated in advance. The DPA imposed a HUF 500,000 fine considering the seriousness and lack of cooperation as aggravating factors, while acknowledging pandemic challenges as mitigating.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors but not systematically. Aggravating factors included violation seriousness and lack of cooperation. Mitigating factors included pandemic challenges and no prior infringements. The nature/gravity was aggravating, previous infringements were mitigating, and cooperation was aggravating.

Answer 75: A toll management company operating CCTV for toll violation detection failed to properly respond to a data subject's access request. The company initially claimed it could only provide information with prosecutor order and DPA permission. After DPA intervention, the company provided available data but without visual material. The DPA imposed a €1,000 fine for delayed satisfaction of access rights, noting it had informed the company in 2017 about such obligations.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature/duration as aggravating due to delayed response and previous infringements as aggravating due to 2017 notification about access rights obligations. Other Art 83(2) factors were not discussed.

Answer 75: National Bank of Greece violated GDPR access rights in multiple fraud-related cases with delays up to 7 months.

Aggravating factors included nature/gravity/duration, intentional/negligent character, previous infringements, and technical/organizational measures. No mitigating factors were identified; cooperation and other factors were considered neutral.

Answer 74: EDPB Opinion 8/2019 on the competence of the supervisory authority in the event of change of circumstances concerning the main or single establishment
Answer 75: The Greek DPA found a golf course company violated Law 2472/1997 by failing to respond to a data subject's access request regarding CCTV footage. The controller claimed the recording system was non-functional but failed to provide evidence. The DPA noted lack of compliance with notification requirements and difficult cooperation with authorities.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature/gravity/duration as aggravating due to delayed response and lack of cooperation. The intentional/negligent character was aggravating as the controller failed to respond properly. Cooperation with supervisory authority was aggravating due to difficult cooperation.

Answer 74: Opinion 15/2011 on the definition of consent;Opinion 5/2014 on anonymisation techniques;Guidelines on the consent under Regulation 2016/679;Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679
Answer 75: The insurance company violated GDPR by not complying with a data subject's erasure request for health data collected during pre-contractual insurance assessment. The DPA found consent was revoked and no other legal basis existed for processing special category data. The company's reliance on an unapproved code of conduct and anonymization instead of erasure was insufficient under GDPR requirements.
Answer 76: The DPA considered processing of special category data as aggravating. It assessed as mitigating that the company followed a draft industry code of conduct practice. The company's actions to anonymize data were considered but did not justify the infringement.

Answer 75: Company X installed a geolocation system in an employee's vehicle but failed to provide complete information about its operation. An employee used the system outside working hours to locate the complainant during leave. The DPA found violations of processing legality and transparency obligations under Articles 5(1)(a), 12, 13 and accountability principle.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. The nature of the violation was aggravating as it involved location data. The incident being isolated, corrective actions taken, and being a first-time offender were mitigating factors. The violation directly affecting a data subject was aggravating while being due to individual employee action was mitigating.

Answer 74: Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679;Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the General Regulation
Answer 75: Alpha Bank S.A. failed to implement security policies when an employee transferred departments, allowing continued system administrator access from 2015-2022. This led to unauthorized access to 6,167 employees' sensitive data including payroll, evaluations, and health information. The DPA found violations of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR due to inadequate security measures and monitoring. A €3,000 fine was imposed considering both aggravating and mitigating factors.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included prolonged unauthorized access capability and processing of special category health data. Mitigating factors included post-incident security enhancements, actions against involved employees, external investigation cooperation, and limited data leakage consequences. The fine was set at the low end of the range due to minor gravity.

Answer 75: The Greek DPA found Elpedison, an electricity company, violated GDPR Article 32 by failing to adequately control processors making promotional calls. Forty complaints revealed call centers made unauthorized calls to numbers on the opt-out registry due to technical/human errors. Elpedison received a €127,709 fine for insufficient processor oversight and was ordered to implement an audit procedure. Three call centers (Call Experts, Zitatel, PLEGMA) also received fines for GDPR violations.
Answer 76: The DPA considered mitigating factors including gradual improvements by Elpedison, difficulties implementing registry provisions, and operational changes by Zitatel. Aggravating factors included call centers' main activity being telemarketing (should know framework) and PLEGMA's previous reprimand. Fines were deemed effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

Answer 74: Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679;Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR
Answer 75: An individual sent a letter with extensive personal data of six complainants (three clergy, three civilians) to six ecclesiastical authorities regarding a neighborhood dispute. The DPA found Article 6(1)(f) GDPR violated as communication was unnecessary and inappropriate for four recipients lacking competence and for all non-clergy data subjects. The fine was reduced due to negligence rather than intent, limited data scope, and no material damage shown.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors: nature/gravity/duration was neutral (limited scope, no material damage); intent/negligence was mitigating (negligence not intent); mitigation actions were mitigating (strictly personal delivery); previous infringements were mitigating (no prior complaints). Other factors were not discussed.

Answer 75: ELTA suffered a cyberattack resulting in unauthorized access and data leakage to Dark Web affecting 4-5 million individuals. The Authority found breaches of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR due to inadequate security measures. The fine was calculated at 1% of annual turnover considering both aggravating and mitigating factors.
Answer 76: The Authority systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included gravity/duration, inadequate technical measures, and categories of data affected. Mitigating factors included actions to mitigate damage, cooperation with authority, and financial difficulties. The fine was set at the lower end of the range due to mitigating circumstances.

Answer 75: The Greek DPA found a small accounting company violated GDPR by installing a CCTV camera that monitored the entire office space rather than just the entrance. The camera allowed real-time remote monitoring by the owner, which was deemed excessive for security purposes and infringed on employee rights. The DPA rejected the legitimate interest claim under Article 6(1)(f) and found breaches of data minimization principles under Article 5(1)(c).
Answer 76: The DPA considered aggravating factors: the nature/gravity of infringement and inadequate technical measures. Mitigating factors: small company size, camera no longer operational, first violation, and economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic.

Answer 74: Opinion 2/2017 of the Working Group of article 29;Guidelines 2/2019 of the European Council on Data Protection;Guidelines 5/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679;Guidelines and the implementation and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 WP253
Answer 75: A private tutoring center employer continuously monitored an employee's online teaching sessions via Zoom despite explicit objections. The DPA found violations of Articles 5(1)(a), 5(2), 13, and 21 GDPR for unlawful processing, lack of transparency, and failure to honor the right to object. The employer failed to establish a valid legal basis as consent was invalid due to power imbalance and legitimate interests were not properly substantiated.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors including the gravity of violating fundamental principles (aggravating), the negligent rather than intentional character (mitigating), and no previous infringements (mitigating). The fine was imposed considering these factors and the need for proportionality and deterrence.

Answer 75: The Municipality of Patras published a complainant's personal data (name, profession, workplace, political beliefs, email content) on its official website regarding a school committee decision. The DPA found this violated the data minimization principle under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR as the data exceeded what was necessary for citizen information purposes. The fine was imposed considering the violation of a fundamental principle and the Municipality's cooperation in removing the content.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the violation of a fundamental principle aggravating, while the Municipality's cooperation, lack of previous violations, and removal of content were mitigating factors. The data not being special categories was neutral. The fine was proportionate to the gravity of the violation.

Answer 75: The Greek DPA partially revoked its previous decision against MZN HELLAS for sending unsolicited marketing SMS after the complainant objected. New evidence showed the violation was due to employee negligence rather than inadequate procedures. The fine was reduced from €20,000 to €5,000 for violations of Articles 17, 21(3), and 12(3), while the Article 25(1) violation finding was revoked.
Answer 76: The DPA considered mitigating factors including that the violation was due to negligence not fraud, the company had appropriate procedures in place, it was the first violation, and the adverse financial situation due to Covid-19. The violation related to data subject rights exercise was considered aggravating in the original decision.

Answer 74: Guidelines on the application and determination of administrative fines for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 WP253
Answer 75: A debt management company made continuous phone calls to a complainant regarding debts that had been discharged through court proceedings under Law 3869/2010. The DPA found no legal basis for processing under Article 6 GDPR as court decisions had eliminated both guarantor and general partner liability. The company also violated Article 12(2) by refusing to process data subject rights requests based on pretextual identification issues.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the continuous nature of violations aggravating, the absence of previous violations mitigating, and that no special categories of data were affected as neutral. The violations fell under the upper category of administrative fines under Article 83(5)(a) and (b).

Answer 75: The Greek DPA rejected a complaint regarding access to historical school records for genealogical research. The Authority found the complaint did not constitute a valid data protection rights exercise under Article 15 GDPR but rather a research request. The DPA maintained its filing decision, stating it lacked competence to order access to historical records for research purposes.

Answer 75: A lawyer failed to respond to a client's repeated access requests from 2019-2021 regarding case files containing personal data. The DPA found violations of Article 15 (right of access) and Article 31 (cooperation obligation), noting the lawyer's complete non-response and lack of cooperation during the investigation. The DPA imposed two €700 fines totaling €1400 based on the prolonged duration, isolated nature, and lack of financial benefit from the violations.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors systematically. Aggravating factors included long duration of violation and non-cooperation with authority. Mitigating factors included no previous infringements and isolated nature. Neutral factors included that no special category data was involved and only one data subject affected.

Answer 75: The Municipality of Metamorfosi disclosed a complainant's name and address to the property owner being complained about without proper transparency measures. The DPA found violations of Articles 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(c) GDPR regarding transparency and data minimization principles. The disclosure was deemed unnecessary for the urban planning violation control purpose.
Answer 76: The DPA considered multiple mitigating factors: the breach was limited in nature, no damage was claimed, no special category data was involved, defendant could not mitigate damage, no previous violations, and defendant had implemented improved complaint procedures. These factors led to a reprimand instead of a fine.

Answer 75: The DPA found violations regarding failure to provide CCTV footage of a minor child despite access request, unauthorized transfer of sensitive health data to a third party without parental consent, and improper dissemination of court decision about the child to multiple recipients. The defendant failed to demonstrate that providing the footage would adversely affect employees' rights and did not cooperate effectively with the Authority.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature of infringements (basic GDPR principles), involvement of minor's sensitive data, and lack of cooperation as aggravating factors. The defendant's status as a non-profit association fully funded by the Ministry of Health was considered mitigating.

Answer 74: Guidelines 18/2018 on Personal data breach notification under Regulation;Guidelines 09/2022 for the notification of incidents of violation;Guidelines 04/2022 for the calculation of administrative fines
Answer 75: Alpha Bank unlawfully disclosed complainant's credit card transactions to his wife without legal basis. The bank failed to properly investigate the breach incident, delayed handling for months, and incorrectly assessed the risk as negligible. The DPA found violations of Article 5(1)(a) and (f) GDPR and Article 33 GDPR, imposing fines totaling €60,000.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors systematically. Aggravating factors included multi-month delay, indifference to compliance, transferring responsibility to data subject, and underestimating consequences. Mitigating factors included isolated incident and no previous similar violations. Neutral factor was adequate organizational measures in place.

Answer 75: The Greek DPA fined a political candidate €1,000 for sending unsolicited SMS campaign messages without proper consent. The candidate obtained phone numbers from professional contacts rather than previous political engagement, violating Article 11 of Law 3471/2006. The DPA found no prior consent or legitimate previous contact, though noted the candidate provided opt-out mechanisms and cooperated with the investigation.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the intentional nature of the violation and awareness of legal requirements as aggravating factors. Cooperation with the authority, provision of opt-out mechanisms, and no prior infringements were mitigating factors. The fine was deemed proportionate to the gravity of the infringement.

Answer 74: Guidelines 1/2023 for the processing of personal data for the purpose of communication of a political nature;Guidelines for the application and determination of administrative fines for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 (WP 253)
Answer 75: A doctor used patient data from Hospital X for political campaign SMS messages without legal basis. The DPA found violations of Article 5(1)(a) principles (lawfulness, fairness, transparency) and Article 12(2) (facilitating rights exercise). The doctor failed to document data origins and presented contradictory claims during investigation.
Answer 76: The DPA considered nature/gravity/duration as aggravating (special health data, many affected subjects, long duration). Intentional/negligent character was aggravating (gross negligence by medical professional). Cooperation was aggravating (contradictory claims, disorientation attempts). Data categories were aggravating (health data). Other factors were aggravating (ignorance of GDPR by medical professional).

Answer 75: The Greek DPA imposed a €2000 fine on a political candidate for sending unsolicited political emails without consent. The candidate obtained email addresses through professional relationships rather than previous political contact, violating Article 11 of Law 3471/2006. The DPA found the processing unlawful as data was obtained for one purpose (professional) but used for another (political campaigning).
Answer 76: The DPA considered the lack of consent and improper data sourcing as aggravating. Cooperation with authorities and no prior infringements were mitigating. The fine was deemed proportionate to the gravity of the infringement.

Answer 74: Guidelines 5/2019 of the European Data Protection Board regarding the criteria governing the right to be forgotten, according to the GDPR, in the cases of search engines
Answer 75: The Greek DPA ordered Google LLC to remove 32 search results linking to articles about complainant's past employment from 2015-2016. The DPA found the information outdated and no longer of public interest, causing disproportionate adverse effects on complainant's professional life and job prospects. Google refused deletion claiming public interest in transparency of public appointments, but DPA determined privacy rights prevailed given the temporal distance and lack of current relevance.

Answer 75: The Hellenic DPA imposed an administrative fine on a parliamentary candidate for illegal sending of SMS messages for political communication purposes. The DPA found the consent mechanism invalid as recipients had not provided proper consent for receiving political marketing messages. The processing was deemed unlawful under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature and gravity of the infringement as aggravating factors, but did not systematically discuss Article 83(2) criteria. The intentional character of sending unsolicited political SMS messages was also treated as an aggravating circumstance.

Answer 75: The National Intelligence Service transmitted employee personal data to other government bodies one day before the relevant law was officially published. The DPA found violations of Article 5(1)(a) (lawfulness) as processing occurred without proper legal basis, and Article 13 (information obligations) as the data subject was not informed. The DPA imposed a €5,000 fine for these violations.
Answer 76: The DPA considered violation of fundamental principles as aggravating and negligence rather than fraud as mitigating. The controller's responsive cooperation was neutral. Other Article 83(2) factors were not discussed.

Answer 74: Guidelines 01/2022 on data subjects' rights – Right of access;Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR;Guidelines for the application and determination of administrative fines for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 WP253
Answer 75: A tutoring school failed to respond to a father's access request regarding his minor child's educational data and tax documents. The DPA found violations of Article 15 (right of access) and Article 12 (transparency obligations) for not providing the requested information, and Article 31 (cooperation with supervisory authority) for inadequate responses to the DPA's inquiries. The DPA imposed separate fines totaling €3,000 for these violations.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included the violation category (highest prescribed), deprivation of access rights, long duration, and non-cooperation with authority. Mitigating factors included negligence rather than intent, affecting only one data subject, no previous violations, no financial benefit obtained, and the defendant's SME status.

Answer 74: EDPB Guidelines 04/2022 on calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR
Answer 75: The Greek DPA found multiple GDPR violations by the Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection, including failure to appoint a DPO, lack of cooperation with the authority, and non-compliance with transparency, security, and accountability requirements. The ministry claimed organizational challenges as a newly established entity but the DPA rejected this justification. Administrative fines totaling €50,000 were imposed for violations of Articles 31, 37, 12, 32, 5, 25, and 30.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included long duration of violations, national level operations, lack of notification to authority, and reluctance to cooperate. Mitigating factors included eventual questionnaire submission and no previous violations. The controller's eventual compliance efforts were noted but insufficient to avoid sanctions.

Answer 75: A patient complained that her doctor posted photos of her body parts on social media without valid consent after she withdrew it. The DPA found the photos constituted personal data as the doctor could identify them through medical records. The DPA determined the consent was invalid due to withdrawal and insufficient transparency about the promotional purpose, violating Articles 5(1)(a) and (b) GDPR.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the unintentional nature of the violation and immediate removal of photos as mitigating factors, while the sensitive medical data nature was aggravating. Other Article 83(2) factors were not systematically discussed.

Answer 74: Guidelines 5/2019 of the European Data Protection Board on the criteria governing the right to be forgotten under the GDPR in the case of search engines
Answer 75: The Greek DPA found Google LLC violated GDPR Articles 12(2), 12(3), 17, and 37(7). The case involved a complainant's right to erasure requests regarding search results about past criminal proceedings. Google failed to provide proper mechanisms for document attachment in deletion requests, sent automated COVID-19 delay messages without proper justification, and didn't publish DPO contact details. The DPA ordered Google to implement file attachment functionality, cease automated delay messages, publish DPO details, and remove one specific search result link.

Answer 74: Guidelines for the application and determination of administrative fines for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 (WP 253); Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR
Answer 75: The Greek DPA found violations regarding the issuance of new identity cards. The Ministry of Citizen Protection failed to provide proper information to data subjects, conducted incorrect information practices, and violated data minimization principles. The DPA imposed fines totaling €150,000 for violations of Articles 13-14 and 35(1) GDPR, and ordered documentation of data inclusion necessity within six months.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature of violations as serious aggravating factors, affecting accountability obligations and data subject rights. The large number of affected subjects (all Greek citizens) was aggravating. The controller's steps toward compliance following DPA intervention were considered mitigating. Other Article 83(2) factors were not systematically discussed.

Answer 74: EDPB Recommendations 01/2020 on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level of protection of personal data
Answer 75: The Bavarian DPA found that a company unlawfully transferred email addresses to Mailchimp in the USA without examining whether supplementary measures were needed under Schrems II. The DPA determined the transfers were impermissible but exercised discretion not to impose fines, citing limited data volume, low sensitivity of email addresses, and the fact that EDPB recommendations were still in consultation phase.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors in deciding against a fine. Nature/gravity was mitigating due to minor infringement (few transfers, low sensitivity data). Negligence was mitigating as only slight degree. No other factors were discussed.

Answer 75: German data protection authorities issued a resolution against a proposed energy supplier pool that would collect positive customer data to identify price-conscious consumers. The DPA found this processing would violate Article 6(1)(f) as it undermines competition objectives and outweighs customers' fundamental rights.

Answer 75: Facebook initially refused complainant's request to correct his date of birth that he had falsely provided as a minor. The HBDI found this refusal violated Article 16 GDPR right to rectification. Facebook subsequently corrected the data and adjusted internal processes. The HBDI issued a warning but no fine due to Facebook's remedial actions and complainant's responsibility for providing false information.
Answer 76: The DPA considered Facebook's remedial actions (correcting data and adjusting processes) and complainant's responsibility for providing false information as mitigating factors. No aggravating factors were discussed. The case was concluded with a warning rather than a fine.

Answer 75: A debt collection service provider refused to comply with a data subject's access request under Article 15 GDPR claiming exemption as a legal service provider under RDG comparable to lawyers' confidentiality obligations. The Hamburg DPA rejected this argument noting lawyers must provide information when performing debt collection services. After issuing an Article 58(2)(c) order to provide information and copies, the provider only gave general information without specific details or copies as required.

Answer 75: A Hamburg company required employees to report illness absences via email distribution list with 25 recipients including colleagues without work connection. Department head compiled and disclosed complainant's illness absences in denunciatory manner. DPA found violations of Art 32 and Art 9 GDPR for insufficient protection of sensitive health data and unnecessary disclosure. Fine imposed for unlawful processing that served neither rights exercise nor legal obligations.
Answer 76: The DPA considered processing of health data as aggravating factor. Extensive cooperation with supervisory authority and payment of compensation to complainant were mitigating factors. The nature of sensitive data was considered as matter of urgency.

Company violated Article 32(1) GDPR due to inadequate disposal concept that relied on delivery personnel to dispose of lists themselves without proper monitoring. Fine was moderate due to company cooperation, revised materials, and no economic damage to subscribers, but aggravated by previous 2019 warning for similar violation and economic advantage from cost savings.
Answer 76: DPA considered previous infringement (aggravating), cooperation with authority (mitigating), actions to mitigate damage through revised materials (mitigating), inadequate technical measures (aggravating), and economic advantage from violation (mitigating factor mentioned but fine still imposed). No systematic Article 83(2) discussion.

Answer 75: This is a legal guidance note from the Hamburg DPA discussing whether Article 32 GDPR security requirements can be waived through data subject consent. The note concludes that controllers must maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures as required by Article 32 GDPR, but data subjects can consent to lower protection levels in individual cases if consent is voluntary under Article 7 GDPR and the controller maintains proper security measures as an available option.

Answer 75: A bank was fined €900,000 for profiling customers for advertising purposes without consent. The bank analyzed digital usage behavior and enriched data with credit agency information to identify customers inclined toward digital media. The DPA found legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) invalid for advertising profiling, as customers' interests prevail and consent is required.
Answer 76: The DPA considered that the company had not used the evaluation results as mitigating, and cooperation throughout the process as mitigating. No other Article 83(2) factors were explicitly discussed.

Answer 75: Knuddels GmbH & Co. KG operated an internet chat platform and stored user passwords in plain text, violating Article 32(1)(a) GDPR. A hacker attack in July 2018 resulted in the theft of 1.8 million user records containing unencrypted passwords. The DPA found Knuddels knowingly stored passwords insecurely despite awareness of security standards, but mitigated the fine due to good cooperation, transparency, and investments in improved security measures.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included the nature/gravity of storing plain text passwords knowingly and the intentional character. Mitigating factors included actions to mitigate damage through transparency and cooperation, no previous infringements, good cooperation with authority, and substantial investments in security improvements. The data breach notification manner was mitigating.

Answer 75: Volkswagen was fined €1.1M for GDPR violations related to testing driver assistance systems. The company failed to provide proper signage informing road users about data collection, lacked a data processing agreement with its service provider, conducted no DPIA, and had inadequate documentation of technical measures. The DPA noted the processing itself was lawful as it served accident prevention purposes, and Volkswagen cooperated extensively and remedied the defects.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the processing purpose (accident prevention) as mitigating, cooperation as mitigating, and lack of organizational measures as aggravating. The violations were described as low-severity and not ongoing.

Answer 74: Guidelines on transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
Answer 75: EDF was fined for multiple GDPR violations including invalid consent for electronic marketing from data brokers, insufficient information transparency, failures in responding to data subject rights requests, and inadequate data security measures using obsolete password hashing functions. The company had over 25 million customers and significant resources but failed to implement proper controls. The DPA acknowledged EDF's remediation efforts but imposed a €600,000 fine considering the seriousness and scope of violations.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature and seriousness of violations as aggravating, while the company's cooperation and remedial actions were mitigating. The company's significant resources and scale of operations were also considered in determining the proportionate fine amount.

Answer 75: CNIL fined Google €50 million for GDPR violations related to Android account creation process. The DPA found Google failed to provide transparent information about data processing purposes (particularly advertising personalization) and did not obtain valid consent for ad personalization. The violations concerned massive data processing operations affecting millions of users through scattered information architecture and pre-ticked default settings.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature/gravity/duration as aggravating due to ongoing violations affecting fundamental rights. The categories of personal data affected were aggravating due to the massive and intrusive nature of processing. Other aggravating factors included the scale of processing and economic model benefits.

Answer 75: SERGIC failed to implement appropriate security measures on its website, allowing unauthorized access to tenant applicants' personal documents through a URL manipulation vulnerability. The company was aware of the security flaw since March 2018 but took six months to implement a definitive fix. The CNIL found violations of Articles 5 (storage limitation) and 32 (security) of GDPR due to excessive data retention and inadequate security controls.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. The nature/gravity/duration was aggravating due to the six-month vulnerability period. The intentional/negligent character was aggravating as the company prioritized system stability over security. Actions to mitigate damage were mitigating as the company eventually fixed the vulnerability. Technical measures were aggravating due to the fundamental security flaw. Data categories were aggravating due to sensitive personal information.

Answer 75: The CNIL sanctioned Amazon Europe Core for violating French cookie rules (Article 82 of Data Protection Act). Cookies were placed on users' terminals without prior consent and without providing clear information about purposes and refusal means. The violation was particularly serious due to the scale of processing and financial benefit derived. The company was fined €35 million and ordered to bring processing into compliance.
Answer 76: The DPA considered nature/gravity/duration as aggravating (Art 83(2)(a)), measures to mitigate damage as mitigating (Art 83(2)(c)), categories of data as aggravating (Art 83(2)(g)), and financial benefit as aggravating (Art 83(2)(k)). Other factors were not discussed.

Answer 75: A medical practitioner configured his home network to allow remote access to medical imaging data but failed to implement basic security measures, leaving medical images and patient data publicly accessible for approximately four months. The CNIL found breaches of Articles 32 (security) and 33 (breach notification) of GDPR, noting the sensitive nature of health data and the large number of patients affected. The practitioner immediately remedied the breach upon notification but failed to report it to CNIL as required.
Answer 76: The CNIL systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included the nature/gravity/duration of breach, categories of data affected (health data), and manner of discovery (media report). Mitigating factors included cooperation with authorities and actions to mitigate damage. The fine was set at €3,000 considering the practitioner's financial capacity.

The authority found breaches of data minimization, storage limitation, accountability, and security principles regarding processing of strike day data in promotion files and DORA tool access controls. The fine was reduced from the proposed amount due to RATP's cooperation and COVID-19 financial impact.
Answer 76: The CNIL systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included the nature/gravity/duration of violations, intentional/negligent character, inadequate technical measures, and sensitive data categories. Mitigating factors included cooperation with authorities, actions to mitigate damage, and the economic context of COVID-19.

Answer 75: The CNIL sanctioned FREE MOBILE for GDPR violations including failure to respond to data access requests, failure to honor marketing opt-outs, insufficient data security measures (sending passwords in clear text), and lack of privacy by design in billing practices. The company processed over 600 data subject requests annually but failed on specific complaints. The DPA considered the breaches serious but isolated rather than systemic.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature and gravity of violations as aggravating factors, while actions taken to mitigate damage were mitigating. The company's negligence regarding fundamental GDPR principles and its position as a major telecom operator were considered. The fine was set at €300,000 considering the isolated nature of breaches compared to subscriber volume.

Answer 75: French DPA found furniture retailer violated GDPR Articles 5(1)(e),13,17,28,32 regarding data retention periods, transparency obligations, right to erasure, processor contracts, and data security. Company failed to define retention periods, provide complete privacy information, properly delete data upon request, establish processor agreements, and implement adequate security measures including weak passwords and obsolete hashing.
Answer 76: DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Nature/gravity/duration was aggravating due to multiple breaches affecting 550,000+ individuals over several years. Intentional/negligent character was aggravating due to significant negligence. Actions to mitigate damage were mitigating as company implemented compliance measures during proceedings. Technical/organizational measures were aggravating due to inadequate security. Previous infringements were mitigating as first-time violation. Cooperation was neutral as met expected level. Categories of personal data were neutral as only standard data.

Answer 75: The CNIL found GIE INFOGREFFE breached GDPR Article 5(1)(e) by retaining personal data beyond its own 36-month policy for over 25% of accounts without proper archiving procedures. The organization also breached Article 32 through insufficient security measures including 8-character password limits without complexity requirements, plain text password transmission/storage, and lack of automatic anonymization. The DPA emphasized the structural nature of these violations affecting over 3.7 million accounts and the defendant's status as a judicial public body requiring particular rigor.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included nature/gravity/duration of violations, negligent character, inadequate technical measures, and categories of data affected. Mitigating factors included cooperation with authority and actions to mitigate damage. The origin of complaint was considered neutral.

Answer 75: French ministries used ENSAP database of 2.3M public officials to send political communication about pension reform. CNIL found this violated purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b) as the processing was incompatible with ENSAP's authorized administrative purposes. The restricted formation issued a call to order against both ministries as joint controllers.
Answer 76: CNIL considered the large number of affected persons (2.3M) as aggravating and the ministries' remedial actions (census of opt-outs and planned interface improvements) as mitigating. Other Article 83(2) factors were not discussed.

Answer 75: The municipality of Kourou failed to appoint a data protection officer despite being required to do so since May 25,2018 and ignored multiple CNIL communications including a formal notice and previous fine. The CNIL imposed a €5,000 fine for breaches of Articles 31 and 37 GDPR and issued an injunction with daily penalty for non-compliance.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors including nature/gravity/duration (aggravating), intentional/negligent character (aggravating), previous infringements (aggravating), cooperation with authority (aggravating), and compliance with prior orders (aggravating). The financial situation of the municipality was considered in determining the fine amount.

Answer 75: Amazon France Logistique implemented excessive employee monitoring through scanner data collection, processing detailed productivity/quality indicators and inactivity periods. The CNIL found violations of data minimization, legal basis, transparency and security obligations. The processing created disproportionate pressure on workers through constant surveillance of their actions to the nearest second.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors including nature/gravity/duration as aggravating, intentional/negligent character as aggravating, actions to mitigate damage as mitigating, and cooperation with authority as mitigating. The fine was set at €32 million considering the seriousness and company turnover.

Answer 75: HUBSIDE.STORE conducted mass marketing via SMS and phone calls using prospect files purchased from data brokers. The CNIL found invalid consent collection through competition forms that didn't allow clear choice, and invalid legitimate interest as data subjects couldn't reasonably expect prospecting. The company also failed to provide adequate information to data subjects under Article 14. A €525,000 fine was imposed for breaches of CPCE Article L.34-5 and GDPR Articles 6 and 14.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature and gravity of violations as aggravating factors, particularly the fundamental nature of the principles breached and the massive scale of processing. The company's financial capacity and market position were also considered in determining the fine amount.

Answer 75: CEGEDIM SANTÉ collected pseudonymized health data from doctors' patient records via its CROSSWAY software to create a health data warehouse for commercial studies. The CNIL found the data was not anonymous but pseudonymized, requiring authorization under French health data laws. The company breached Article 66 of French Data Protection Law and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by unlawfully collecting HRi teleservice data.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors including nature/gravity/duration (aggravating), categories of personal data (aggravating), and cooperation with authority (mitigating). The fine was set at €800,000 considering the severity, scope of processing, and sensitive health data involved.

Answer 74: Guidelines on transparency under Regulation (EU) 2016/679;Guidelines on the rights of data subjects - right of access
Answer 75: KASPR developed a browser extension that collected professional contact details from LinkedIn users, including those who restricted visibility. CNIL found breaches of Articles 5(1)(e),6,12,14,15 GDPR. Processing lacked legal basis as legitimate interest invalid when against data subjects' reasonable expectations. Company ordered to cease unlawful collection and improve transparency.
Answer 76: DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Nature/gravity/duration was aggravating due to fundamental principle violations affecting millions. Intentional/negligent character was aggravating as company showed negligence. Actions to mitigate damage were mitigating as company implemented some compliance measures. Other aggravating factors included financial benefits derived from unlawful processing.

Answer 75: CNIL sanctioned a controller and processor for failing to implement adequate security measures against credential stuffing attacks on an e-commerce website. Between 2018-2020, attackers accessed personal data of approximately 40,000 customers including names, email addresses, loyalty card information, and order details. The companies were slow to develop effective countermeasures, taking a year to implement a bot detection tool while simpler measures like IP rate limiting or CAPTCHA could have been deployed faster.
Answer 76: The CNIL considered the nature/gravity/duration of infringement as aggravating due to prolonged vulnerability period. The intentional/negligent character was aggravating due to delayed response. Technical/organizational measures were aggravating as security measures were insufficient. Categories of data affected were aggravating as sensitive customer data was compromised. Actions to mitigate damage were mitigating as companies eventually implemented security improvements.

Answer 75: The Finnish DPA found Suomen Asiakastieto Oy violated GDPR by failing to comply with an order to remove incorrect payment default entries from credit registers. The controller's case-by-case assessment of court judgments led to processing without proper legal basis. The sanction board imposed a €440,000 fine for non-compliance with the supervisory authority's order, considering the intentional nature and financial benefit of avoiding compliance costs.
Answer 76: The DPA systematically discussed Article 83(2) factors. Aggravating factors included nature/gravity of breach, intentional character, responsibility level, and financial benefit from avoiding compliance costs. Mitigating factor was actions taken to mitigate damage. Neutral factors included previous infringements, cooperation level, and manner infringement became known.

Answer 75: The Finnish DPA ordered a credit registry to correct erroneous default entries based on final court judgments. The DPA found that judgments resulting from disputed cases where payment obligation was reasonably contested cannot indicate insolvency or unwillingness to pay. The controller's case-by-case assessment approach violated GDPR lawfulness principles and Finnish credit information requirements.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature/gravity/duration of infringement aggravating due to large-scale processing and significant impact on data subjects' rights. Technical/organizational measures were aggravating as the controller failed to implement proper safeguards. Categories of personal data affected were aggravating due to sensitive financial information. Other mitigating factors included difficult legal interpretation of Credit Information Act conditions.

Answer 74: WP29 Guidelines on the Reporting of a Personal Data Breach under Regulation (EU) 2016/679;Report of the Working Party on the Implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (TATTI)
Answer 75: The Finnish DPA found the Ministry of Foreign Affairs violated Articles 33 and 34 GDPR by failing to report a Pegasus spyware security breach within 72 hours and not notifying data subjects without undue delay. The breach targeted posted personnel abroad. The controller cited national security and investigation complexities as reasons for delay, but the DPA found these insufficient justification under GDPR requirements. A reprimand was issued instead of a fine considering the circumstances.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature and gravity of the breach (Article 83(2)(a)) as aggravating factors, noting the breach targeted posted personnel working abroad. The categories of personal data affected (Article 83(2)(g)) were also considered aggravating. Other Article 83(2) factors were not systematically discussed.

Answer 75: Y Oy processed personal data as a processor for XX Oy in telemarketing operations without a proper data processing agreement as required by Article 28(3) GDPR. The DPA found Y Oy neglected its obligation to draw up such an agreement. While the breach was considered serious, no fine was imposed due to Y Oy's ceased operations, low turnover, and pending bankruptcy proceedings.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature of Y Oy's business and knowing failure to comply as aggravating factors. Mitigating factors included Y Oy's ceased operations, low turnover (€839.33), and pending bankruptcy application. The sanction panel ultimately found imposing a fine would be disproportionate.

Answer 75: A municipal participatory budgeting service made user profiles publicly searchable and visible, exposing approximately 160,000 individuals' names and activity data. The DPA found violations of Articles 25(2) (data protection by design and by default) and 32(1) (security of processing) as profiles were unnecessarily accessible to unlimited persons. The controller received a reprimand but no fine, as corrective measures had already been implemented.
Answer 76: The DPA considered the nature of the infringement as aggravating (profiles publicly accessible without limitation) and the controller's remedial actions as mitigating (deleted profiles, removed search function). Other Article 83(2) factors were not systematically discussed.

Answer 75: Kesko Oyj processed customer purchase data through its Plussa loyalty program, storing detailed purchase information throughout the customer relationship without purpose-specific retention periods. The DPA found violations of Articles 5(1)(c), 5(1)(e), 25(1) and 25(2) GDPR regarding data minimization, storage limitation, and data protection by design/default. The controller was ordered to define purpose-specific retention periods and delete/anonymize data exceeding these periods.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors but did not impose a fine. Factors considered aggravating included nature/gravity/duration of infringement, technical/organizational measures, and categories of data affected. The sanctions panel found mitigating factors in that storage periods had not yet become disproportionately long compared to industry practice.

Answer 75: Finnish DPA ordered credit registry to correct erroneous default entries based on final court judgments. The DPA found that disputed cases where defendants reasonably contested payment obligations should not result in default entries, as they don't demonstrate insolvency or unwillingness to pay. The controller's case-by-case assessment method violated GDPR lawfulness principle and Finnish credit information requirements.
Answer 76: DPA considered large-scale processing and significant impact on data subject rights as aggravating. Incomplete disclosure practices by Legal Register Center were considered mitigating. Imposition of administrative fine was deemed disproportionate due to difficult interpretation of Credit Information Act conditions.

Answer 74: EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 on consent
Answer 75: The Finnish DPA found an insurance company violated GDPR by processing health data of insurance applicants using overly broad consent forms. The company claimed authority under national insurance law, but the DPA ruled this only applies to insured persons, not applicants. The DPA ordered compliance with Article 9 and found the consent mechanism insufficiently specific and voluntary.

Answer 75: Finnish DPA found controller violated Article 32 security requirements for online appointment booking system that allowed brute-force attacks to determine personal identification numbers. The system processed personal IDs on large scale without adequate security measures. Controller implemented strong identification after breach was discovered.
Answer 76: DPA considered nature/gravity/duration and technical measures as aggravating factors. Actions to mitigate damage and other factors were mitigating since controller fixed vulnerability promptly after discovery.

Answer 75: The Finnish DPA found a municipal education authority violated GDPR principles by making students' personal data (names, roles, email addresses, schools, classes) visible in email address books across all city schools. The controller failed to demonstrate necessity for such wide visibility. The DPA issued a reprimand and compliance order to limit data visibility to necessary contexts.
Answer 76: The DPA discussed Article 83(2) factors briefly, finding the nature/gravity (widespread children's data exposure), inadequate technical measures, and sensitive data categories as aggravating factors for the violation.
